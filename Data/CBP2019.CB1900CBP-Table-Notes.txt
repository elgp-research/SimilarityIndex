<p><b>API Information:</b><br>

For more information, see <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/cbp-nonemp-zbp/cbp-api.html"> Census.gov: Developers: Available APIs, County Business Patterns and Nonemployer Statistics (1986-2018): County Business Patterns (CBP) APIs.</a></p>

<p><b>Methodology:</b><br>
In accordance with U.S. Code, Title 13, Section 9, no data are published that would disclose the operations of an individual employer. The data are subject to nonsampling error such as errors of self-classification, as well as errors of response, nonreporting and coverage. Data users who create their own estimates using data from this file should cite the U.S. Census Bureau as the source of the original data only. </p>

<p>To comply with disclosure avoidance guidelines, data rows with fewer than three contributing establishments are not presented. For detailed information about the methods used to collect and produce statistics, including sampling see <a href="https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cbp/technical-documentation/methodology.html"> County Business Patterns: Survey Methodology. </a></p>

<p>Note: The Census Bureau did not collect district boundaries for the 117th Congress, in keeping with the practice of not collecting the session which aligns with the decennial census. As a result, County Business Patterns estimates were tabulated using 116th Congressional districts and state and local geographies.</p>
